v0.1.0 (2017-03-26)
===================

### Introducing resource services
Every entity resource now has its own service definition for handling api communication. With this release, we don't store `contentful client` and `space` objects inside entities anymore. Resource services now get `spaceID` as a string parameter when it is neccessary.

With the old versions, in order to create a new `ContentType`, for example, you first need to observe `Space` object. That is no longer required. The problem with the old method was that you had to make an extra api request to observe the `Space` in order to interact with rest of the resources. The following example demonstras the difference between old and new version.

```go
// prior to v0.1.0
space, err := cma.GetSpace("space-id") // this call was making an extra api call
contentTypes, err := space.ContentTypes()

// after v0.1.0
contentType := &contentful.ContentType{ ... }
spaceID := "space-id"
cma.ContentTypes.Upsert(spaceID, contentType) // now we are passing spaceID as string
```

You can access available resources as follows:

```go
cma := contentful.NewCMA("token")
cma.Spaces
cma.APIKeys
cma.Assets
cma.ContentTypes
cma.Entries
cma.Locales
cma.Webhooks
```

Every resource service exposes the following interface:

`List(spaceID string) *Collection`

`Get(spaceID, contentTypeID string)(*ContentType, error)`

`Upsert(spaceID string, ct *ContentType) error`

`Delete(spaceID string, ct *ContentType) error`

### Create resource instancas directly from their model definitions

All `New{ResourceName}`, such as `NewContentType`, `NewSpace`, functions are removed from the SDK. It turned out that it wasn't a good practice in golang. Instead, you can directly initiate resource entities directly from their models, such as:

```go
contentType := &contentful.ContentType{
    Name: "name",
    ... other fields
}
```
